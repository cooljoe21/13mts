# Issues-Descriptions+Usage
- Issues are referring to, for the purpose of this project, tasks and complications Ryan or Tatsuya has found and would assign it to someone
- Tasks would be things such as "we need a code for this actions" or "we need a model of this." 
- Complications would be errors in the code or if someone disagrees with the looks of a particular model and we need someone to fix it
- To fix the issues that arises in the project, it'll be fix via the pull requests 
- Note that only Ryan and Tatsuya can assign an issue, however if anyone have an issue, you can discuss it with one of the two

# Pull Requests 
- This is how we will resolve the issues that would come up along the game's processes
- The pull request will be done via the creation of a new file that will reference the original issue
- This is done in the code page by creating a new code/file, going to the end of the page to find the selection that offers it to make a separate branch+a pull request
- Select this to create a pull request and add a comment on the new branch to indicate that the pull request is to resolve an issue 
- Then when this is done, go to the comment section and there would be a selection to reference an issue; find the appropriate issue and select it and there, the pull request has been created
